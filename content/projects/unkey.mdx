Arcanium is a decentralised P2P solution to a highly centralised real estate marketplace offering P2P mortgages, enabling transparency and accessibility. Arcanium reduces intermediaries, fees and time on a real estate transaction by enabling all properties to be minted on the blockchain as NFTs. Minting is fully permisonless as users just need a certified local appraiser report, survey report and other legal documents.
