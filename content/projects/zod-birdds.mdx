A decentralised market to bet on weather conditions in different towns. Users can stake a certian amount of Solana on what they believe the weather conditions will be like in a city (e.g. Will it rain more thabn <3mm in Berlin tomorrow? Yes or No). The odds are dynamic and calcualteed from an external weather service, however the odds are moved by what percentage of users have voted in favour/against the odds (e.g. initial odds are 2:1, but  70% of users vote against the odds, the odds will be shifted). Creating bets is fully permisionless.
