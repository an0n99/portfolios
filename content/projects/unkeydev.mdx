Plexonic is a website development agency producing bespoke websites for their clients. I carried out a short internship there were I learnt about TailWindCCS, TypeScript and how to conduct proper digitial marketing. I planned, built and conducted a full digital marketing campaign on FaceBook which successfully signed three new clients for Plexonic. The marketing campaign involved graphic designing, SEO, cold calling and many other aspects.
